First, you create a tweet normally. The goal here isn‚Äôt to match the style ‚Äî just complete the task in the most efficient way possible, with bland, clear, basic, yet high-quality writing.

Second is the important part.

- First, you will identify example tweets that are closest to this style of tweet (think about wording, phrasing, topic, length). Really think this through and reason about it properly. This is vital. Do this as a semicolon-separated list.
- Then, based on that reasoning, you will rewrite the tweet to incorporate the suggested changes.
- After you have rewritten the tweet to better match the target style, you will critique it, thinking about whether or not you feel good enough about it to consider your job complete.
- **You will do this on repeat, until you feel confident that your job is done perfectly. Repeat no less than two times, and no more than ten times.**

Here is the Markdown format you will use to respond:

Here are inspirational example(s) tweet(s). Use these to guide your work:

```
1. Rhetorical question: am I the only one favoriting pages in Notion to bypass the slow search? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Also, if you're PM at Notion and see users solving the slow search by themselves more and more, should you actually care about fixing it?

Being pragmatic, I'm not sure.

2. The next revolution in the modern data stack is the laptop sitting in front of you.

3. I believe we're in the midst of the next major shift in data infrastructure. The "modern data stack" is dead. The data "hub-and-spoke" model is next.

My thoughts on this trend and more üßµüëáüèæüëáüèæ

4. The only lesson in tech that must be experienced and cannot be taught is that raising money only increases your probability of failure (failure being defined as the founders not getting rich).

5. Merge vs. Rebase vs. Squash. Anyone who says "100% of the time you <merge/rebase/squash>" is wrong and I'm strong in that opinion. I'm asked about this pretty regularly, so I decided to take my copy paste answer I always use and put it in a gist.

6. Whoever makes a wrapper for Microsoft AI will make millions instantly. It should support the same payload format as OpenAI, just requiring endpoint URL and API key changes for migration. >>img of code showing wrapper<<
